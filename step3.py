# Alyssa - Use mod 2 linear algebra (Gaussian elimination) on exponents to find products of these xâ€™s that is a square (zero vector)
# If a = +-b (mod n), try again
# Find more smooth values of x^2 - n, find a new linear dependency - how?
# Otherwise, take gcd(a - b, n) to get a nontrivial factor
